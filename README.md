# P2P FTP/HTTP
A simple Peer to Peer file transfer tool over HTTP.

There comes a problem when sharing a file either small or big between to computers in the same network or a company where the file cannot be shared simply in an email or through common shared drive due to file type restriction or file size limitation or unavailability of space for sharing through shared memory spaces.

This tool allows the user to generate a simple URI that automatically fetches the required files, how big the file may be, over the local network direcly from the user's disk.

After generating the file download link, simply send it to the recipients who can open the link in their browser to download the file.
